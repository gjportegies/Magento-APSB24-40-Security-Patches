# Magento-APSB24-40-Security-Patches (CVE-2024-34102)

This repository contains Magento 2 patch files for the recently found security issue.
The patch files aim to fix the CVE-2024-34102 vulnerability.

Unfortunately I did not have the time to validate the patches for each individual Magento 2 version.
I just modified the official patch to be compatible with specific older versions that I needed.
